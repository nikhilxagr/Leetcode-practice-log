## 💡 Common Patterns

Medium array problems typically involve:

1. **Sliding Window** - Dynamic window for subarrays
2. **Two Pointers** - Start and end pointer manipulation
3. **Divide and Conquer** - Breaking problems into subproblems
4. **Dynamic Programming** - Optimal substructure problems
5. **Prefix/Suffix Arrays** - Precomputation for efficiency
6. **Binary Search** - On sorted or partially sorted arrays

## 🎯 Tips for Success

- 📊 Draw out examples to visualize the problem
- 🔍 Look for patterns in sample test cases
- ⚡ Think about optimization from the start
- 🧪 Test edge cases (duplicates, negatives, sorted arrays)
- 📝 Write pseudocode before coding
- 🎨 Consider multiple approaches before implementing
